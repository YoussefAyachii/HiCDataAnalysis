# HiCDataAnalysis

Using chromatin-chromatin interaction scores generated by the Capture Hi-C technology, I developed this R code during my six week internship in the Spicuglia lab, part of the INSERM institute (TAGC) related to the Aix-Marseille University, France, in order to identify the DNA interactions happening between different regions, specifically the interaction of the OAS3 Epromoter with its target promoters OAS1 and OAS2, before and after IFN alpha stress stimulation and then to figure out the changes of the 3D chromatin organization upon this stress stimulation. Please find above the corresponding R code and my Report.
